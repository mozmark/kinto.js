# API documentation

## The `Kinto` constructor

```js
const db = new Kinto(options);
```

`options` is an object defining the following option values:

- `remote`: The remote Kinto server endpoint root URL (eg. `"https://server/v1"`). Not that you *must* define a URL matching the version of the protocol the client supports, otherwise you'll get an error;
- `headers`: The default headers to pass for every HTTP request performed to the Kinto server (eg. `{"Authorization": "Basic bWF0Og=="}`);
- `adapter`: The persistence layer adapter to use for saving data locally (default: `Kinto.adapters.IDB`); alternatively, a `Kinto.adapters.LocalStorage` adapter is also provided; last, if you plan on writing your own adapter, you can read more about how to do so in the [Extending Kinto.js](extending.md) section.
- `requestMode`: The HTTP [CORS](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode) mode. Default: `cors`.
- `bucket`: The [Kinto bucket name](http://kinto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/buckets.html) to use for remote syncing (default: "default").
- `dbPrefix`: The prefix for the local database name (default: `""`). Use this option to isolate different specific databases, eg. for storing distinct users data.

## Collections

By default, collections are persisted locally in IndexedDB.

> #### Notes
>
> A `localStorage` adapter is also available, though we suggest to stick with IndexedDB whenever you can, as it's faster, more reliable and accepts greater data quotas withouth requiring specific configuration.

Selecting a collection is done by calling the `collection()` method, passing it the resource name:

```js
const articles = db.collection("articles");
```

The collection object has the following (read-only) attribute:

* **lastModified**: last synchronization timestamp, `null` if never sync'ed.

> #### Notes
>
> - A single dedicated database and store are created per collection.
> - All transactional operations are asynchronous and rely on [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Creating a record

```js
articles.create({title: "foo"})
  .then(console.log.bind(console))
  .catch(console.error.bind(console));
```

Result is:

```js
// result
{
  data: {
    id: "2dcd0e65-468c-4655-8015-30c8b3a1c8f8",
    title: "foo",
  }
}
```

> #### Notes
>
> - Records identifiers are generated locally using [UUID v4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_.28random.29).

## Retrieving a single record

```js
articles.get("2dcd0e65-468c-4655-8015-30c8b3a1c8f8")
  .then(console.log.bind(console))
  .catch(console.error.bind(console));
```

Result:

```js
{
  data: [
    {
      id: "2dcd0e65-468c-4655-8015-30c8b3a1c8f8",
      title: "bar"
    }
  ]
}
```

> #### Notes
>
> - The promise will be rejected if no record is found for that id.

## Updating a record

```js
var existing = {
  id: "2dcd0e65-468c-4655-8015-30c8b3a1c8f8",
  title: "bar"
};

var updated = Object.assign(existing, {
  title: "baz"
});

articles.update(updated)
  .then(console.log.bind(console));
```

Result is:

```js
{
  data: {
    id: "2dcd0e65-468c-4655-8015-30c8b3a1c8f8",
    title: "baz",
    last_modified: 1432222889337
  }
}
```

> #### Notes
>
> - An id is required, otherwise the promise will be rejected.

## Deleting records

By default, local deletion is performed *virtually*, until the collection is actually synced to the remote server.

```js
articles.delete("2dcd0e65-468c-4655-8015-30c8b3a1c8f8")
  .then(console.log.bind(console));
```

Result:

```js
{
  data: [
    {
      id: "2dcd0e65-468c-4655-8015-30c8b3a1c8f8",
      title: "foo",
      _status: "deleted"
    }
  ]
}
```

> #### Notes
>
> - An id is required, otherwise the promise will be rejected;
> - Virtual deletions aren't retrieved when calling `#get()` and `#list()`.

## Listing records

```js
articles.list()
  .then(console.log.bind(console));
```

Result is:

```js
{
  data: [
    {
      id: "705b17be-e957-4c14-8f4c-86f8eaac29c0",
      title: "foo"
    },
    {
      id: "68e63131-3859-40cc-a4f7-b237ca179329",
      last_modified: 1432222889336,
      title: "Web page"
    },
  ]
}
```

> #### Notes
>
> - Records with `last_modified` attribute were sync'ed on a server.

### Filtering

Records can be filtered using the `filters` parameter mentioning field names and their expected value:

```js
articles.list({filters: {unread: true}})
  .then(console.log.bind(console));
```

> #### Notes
>
> - If several fields are specified, an implicit *and* is used.
> - As mentioned in the [limitations](limitations.md) section, until [local DB indices are implemented](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js/issues/66), the filter is performed in memory.


### Sorting

Records can be sorted using the `sort` parameter:

```js
articles.list({sort: "-title"})
  .then(console.log.bind(console));
```

> #### Notes
>
> - Prefix field name with `-` for descending order.
> - By default, the records are sorted on `last_modified` in descending order.
> - As mentioned in the [limitations](limitations.md) section, the sort is performed in memory.


## Clearing the collection

This will remove all existing records from the collection:

```js
articles.clear()
  .then(console.log.bind(console));
```

Result:

```js
{
  data: [],
  permissions: {}
}
```

## Fetching and publishing changes

Synchronizing local data with remote ones is performed by calling the `#sync()` method.

![](images/sync-flow.png)

Synopsis:

1. Fetch remote changes since last synchronization;
2. Fail on any conflict encountered;
    - The developer has to handle them manually using [`#resolve()`](#resolving-conflicts), and call `#sync()` again when done;
3. If everything went fine, publish local changes;
    - Fail on any publication conflict detected;
        * If `strategy` is set to `Kinto.syncStrategy.SERVER_WINS`, no client data will overwrite the remote data;
        * If `strategy` is set to `Kinto.syncStrategy.CLIENT_WINS`, conflicting server records will be overwritten with local changes;
        * If `strategy` is set to `Kinto.syncStrategy.MANUAL`, both incoming and outgoing conflicts will be reported in a dedicated array.

```js
articles.sync()
  .then(console.log.bind(console))
  .catch(err => {
    if (err.response && err.response.status === 401) {
      console.error('HTTP status code indicates auth problem');
    }
  });
```

### Error handling

If anything goes wrong during sync, `colllection.sync()` will reject its promise with an `error` object, as follows:

* If an unexpected HTTP status is received from the server, `error.response` will contain that response, for you to inspect
    (see the example above for detecting 401 Unauthorized errors).
* If the server is unreachable, `error.response` will be undefined, but `error.message` will equal
    `'HTTP 0; TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.'`.

### Synchronization strategies

For publication conflicts, the `sync()` method accepts a `strategy` option, which itself accepts the following values:

- `Kinto.syncStrategy.MANUAL` (default): Conflicts are reflected in a `conflicts` array as a result, and need to be resolved manually;
- `Kinto.syncStrategy.SERVER_WINS`: Server data will always be preserved;
- `Kinto.syncStrategy.CLIENT_WINS`: Client data will always be preserved.

> Note:
> `strategy` only applies to *outgoing* conflicts. *Incoming* conflicts will still
> be reported in the `conflicts` array. See [`resolving conflicts section`](#resolving-conflicts).

You can override default options by passing `#sync()` a new `options` object; Kinto will merge these new values with the default ones:

```js
import Collection from "kinto/lib/collection";

articles.sync({
  strategy: Kinto.syncStrategy.CLIENT_WINS,
  headers: {Authorization: "Basic bWF0Og=="}
})
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

The synchronization updates the local data, and provides information about performed operations.
Sample result:

```js
{
  ok: true,
  lastModified: 1434270764485,
  conflicts: [], // Outgoing and incoming conflicts
  errors:    [], // Errors encountered, if any
  created:   [], // Created locally
  updated:   [], // Updated locally
  deleted:   [], // Deleted locally
  skipped:   [], // Skipped imports
  published: [], // Successfully published
  resolved:  [], // Resolved conflicts, according to selected strategy
}
```

## Resolving conflicts manually

When using `Kinto.syncStrategy.MANUAL`, if conflicts occur, they're listed in the `conflicts` property; they must be resolved locally and `sync()` called again.

The `conflicts` array is in this form:

```js
{
  // â€¦
  conflicts: [
    {
      type: "incoming", // can also be "outgoing" if stategy is MANUAL
      local: {
        _status: "created",
        id: "233a018a-fd2b-4d39-ba85-8bf3e13d73ec",
        title: "local title",
      },
      remote: {
        id: "233a018a-fd2b-4d39-ba85-8bf3e13d73ec",
        title: "remote title",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Once the developer is done with merging records, conflicts are marked as
resolved using the `#resolve()` method of the collection:

```js
function sync() {
  return articles.sync()
    .then(res => {
      if (res.ok)
        return res;

      // If conflicts, take remote version and sync again.
      return Promise.all(res.conflicts.map(conflict => {
        return articles.resolve(conflict, conflict.remote);
      }))
      .then(_ => sync());
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
}
```

Here we're solving encountered conflicts by picking all remote versions. After conflicts being properly addressed, we're syncing the collection again, until no conflicts occur.

## Handling server backoff

If the Kinto server instance is under heavy load or maintenance, their admins can [send a Backoff header](http://kinto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/cliquet/backoff.html) and it's the responsibily for clients to hold on performing more requests for a given amount of time, expressed in seconds.

When this happens, Kinto.js will reject calls to `#sync()` with an appropriate error message specifying the number of seconds you need to wait before calling it again.

While not necessarily recommended, if you ever want to bypass this restriction, you can pass the `ignoreBackoff` option set to `true`:

```js
articles.sync({ignoreBackoff: true})
  .then(â€¦)
```

## Events

The `Kinto` instance and its other dependencies expose an `events` property you can subscribe public events from. That `events` property implements nodejs' [EventEmitter interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter).

### The `backoff` event

Triggered when a `Backoff` HTTP header has been received from the last received response from the server, meaning clients should hold on performing further requests during a given amount of time.

The `backoff` event notifies what's the backoff release timestamp you should wait until before performing another `#sync()` call:

```js
const kinto = new Kinto();

kinto.events.on("backoff", function(releaseTime) {
  const releaseDate = new Date(releaseTime).toLocaleString();
  alert(`Backed off; wait until ${releaseDate} to retry`);
});
```

### The `deprecated` event

Triggered when an `Alert` HTTP header is received from the server, meaning that a feature has been deprecated; the `event` argument received by the event listener contains the following deprecation information:

- `type`: The type of deprecation, which in ou case is always `soft-eol` (`hard-eol` alerts trigger an `HTTP 410 Gone` error);
- `message`: The deprecation alert message;
- `url`: The URL you can get information about the related deprecation policy.

```js
const kinto = new Kinto();

kinto.events.on("deprecated", function(event) {
  console.log(event.message);
});
```

## Transformers

Transformers are basically hooks for encoding and decoding records, which can work synchronously or asynchronously.

### Remote transformers

Remote transformers aim at encoding records before pushing them to the remote server, and decoding them back when pulling changes. Remote transformers are registered through the optional second argument of `Kinto#collection()`, which accepts `Kinto.transformers.RemoteTransformer`-derived object instances in its `remoteTransformers` array.

```js
import Kinto from "kinto";

function update(obj1, obj2) {
  return Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
}

class MyRemoteTransformer extends Kinto.transformers.RemoteTransformer {
  encode(record) {
    return update(record, {title: record.title + "!"});
  }

  decode(record) {
    return update(record, {title: record.title.slice(0, -1)});
  }
}

const kinto = new Kinto({remote: "https://my.server.tld/v1"});
coll = kinto.collection("articles", {
  remoteTransformers: [ new MyRemoteTransformer() ]
});
```

> #### Notes
>
> - The `decode` method should be the strict reverse version of `encode`;
> - While this example transformer returns the modified record synchronously, you can also use promises to make it asynchronous â€” see [dedicated section](#async-transformers).

Calling `coll.sync()` here will store encoded records on the server; when pulling for changes, the client will decode remote data before importing them, so you're always guaranteed to have the local database containing data in clear:

```js
coll.create({title: "foo"}).then(_ => coll.sync())
// remotely saved:
// {id: "125b3bff-e80f-4823-8b8f-bfae10bfc3e8", title: "foo!"}
// locally saved:
// {id: "125b3bff-e80f-4823-8b8f-bfae10bfc3e8", title: "foo"}
```

> #### Notes
>
> This mechanism is especially useful for implementing a cryptographic layer, to ensure remote data are stored in a secure fashion. Kinto.js will provide one in a near future.

### Local transformers

In a near future, Kinto.js will provide transfomers aimed at providing facilities to encode and decode records when persisted locally; you'll have to extend from `LocalTransformer` though.

### Async transformers

Transformers can also work asynchronously by returning a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise):

```js
class MyAsyncRemoteTransformer extends Kinto.transformers.RemoteTransformer {
  encode(record) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(update(record, {title: record.title + "!"}));
      }, 10);
    });
  }

  decode(record) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(update(record, {title: record.title.slice(0, -1)}));
      }, 10);
    });
  }
}

coll = kinto.collection("articles", {
  remoteTransformers: [ new MyAsyncRemoteTransformer() ]
});
```

### Multiple transformers

The remoteTransformers field of the options object passed to `Kinto#collection` is an Array. That means you can chain multiple encoding operations, with the decoding ones being processed in the reverse order:

```js
class TitleCharTransformer extends Kinto.transformers.RemoteTransformer {
  constructor(char) {
    super();
    this.char = char;
  }

  encode(record) {
    return update(record, {title: record.title + this.char});
  }

  decode(record) {
    return update(record, {title: record.title.slice(0, -1)});
  }
}

coll = kinto.collection("articles", {
  remoteTransformers: [
    new TitleCharTransformer("!"),
    new TitleCharTransformer("?")
  ]
});

coll.create({title: "foo"}).then(_ => coll.sync())
// remotely saved:
// {id: "125b3bff-e80f-4823-8b8f-bfae10bfc3e8", title: "foo!?"}
// locally saved:
// {id: "125b3bff-e80f-4823-8b8f-bfae10bfc3e8", title: "foo"}
```

### Creating transformers in ES5

If your JavaScript environment doesn't suppport [ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) just yet, you can derive transformers in an ES5 fashion using `Kinto.createRemoteTransformer` static helper:

```js
var TitleCharTransformer = Kinto.createRemoteTransformer({
  constructor: function(char) {
    this.char = char;
  },

  encode: function(record) {
    return update(record, {title: record.title + this.char});
  },

  decode: function(record) {
    return update(record, {title: record.title.slice(0, -1)});
  }
});

coll = kinto.collection("articles", {
  remoteTransformers: [
    new TitleCharTransformer("!"),
    new TitleCharTransformer("?")
  ]
});
```

> #### Notes
>
> Notice you can define a `constructor` method, though you don't need (and must not) call `super()` within it, unlike with ES6 classes.

### Limitations

There's currently no way to deal with adding transformers to an already filled remote database; that would mean remote data migrations, and both Kinto and Kinto.js don't provide this feature just yet.

**As a rule of thumb, you should only start using transformers on an empty remote collection.**
